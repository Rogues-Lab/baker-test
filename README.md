# Sample Metabaker Hardhat project

This project demonstrates a basic Metabaker Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, and an example config.

After deploying and minting some NFTs, try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.ts
npx hardhat publishMetaToNFTStorage --contract MyToken
```
